When creating or reproducing an archive, a status message gets printed to `STDERR` indicating the archive's location. For example:

    Reproducing archive: /path/to/repro-archive/rlog-sample.pl-20140321.144307
    Created new archive: /path/to/repro-archive/rlog-sample.pl-20140321.144335

### Default

By default, runs are archived in a directory called `repro-archive` that is created in the current working directory (i.e., whichever directory you were in when you executed your script).

### Global

You can set a global archive directory with the environmental variable `REPRO_DIR`. Just add the following line to `~/.bash_profile`:

```sh
export REPRO_DIR=/path/to/archive
```

### Script

You can set a script-level archive directory by passing the desired directory when importing the `Log::Reproducible` module:

```perl
use Log::Reproducible '/path/to/archive';
```

This approach overrides the global archive directory settings.

### Via Command Line

You can override all other archive directory settings by passing the desired directory on the command line when you run your script:

```sh
perl sample.pl --reprodir /path/to/archive
```
