### With the `Log::Reproducible` module

Just add a single line near the top of your Perl script before accessing `@ARGV`, calling a module that manipulates `@ARGV`, or processing command line options with a module like [Getopt::Long](http://perldoc.perl.org/Getopt/Long.html):

```perl
use Log::Reproducible;
```

That's all!

Now, every time you run your script, the command line options and other arguments passed to it will be archived in a simple YAML-formatted log file whose name reflects the script and the date/time it began running.

### With the `perlr` wrapper

Can't or don't want to modify your script?

When you install Log::Reproducible, a wrapper program called `perlr` gets installed in your path. Running scripts with `perlr` automatically loads Log::Reproducible even if your script doesn't.

```sh
perlr script-without-log-reproducible.pl
```
