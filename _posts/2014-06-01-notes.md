Notes can be added to an archive using `--repronote`:

```sh
perl sample.pl --repronote 'This is a note'
```

If the note contains spaces, it must be surrounded by quotes.

Notes can span multiple lines:

```sh
perl sample.pl --repronote "This is a multi-line note:
The moon had
a cat's mustache
For a second
  â€” from Book of Haikus by Jack Kerouac"
```
